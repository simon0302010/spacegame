# Space Game

A pretty bad 2D space game where you shoot at asteroids.

## Installation

You can download the game from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install spacegame
```

Now, it should be installed in your Cargo bin directory, which is usually located at `~/.cargo/bin`.

## Gameplay

Run the game using the following command:

```bash
spacegame
```
> Note: Ensure that your cargo bin directory is in your system's PATH to run the command directly.

Use the arrow keys to navigate your spaceship and the spacebar to shoot at asteroids. You lose health if you collide with an asteroid and get points for destroying them.
